Minimally Supervised Topological Projections of Self-Organizing Maps
====================================================================
This is the implementation of Minimally Supervised Topological Projections of Self-Organizing Maps for regression and classification tasks. 

The code is implemented based on the `SUSI package <https://github.com/felixriese/susi>`_ with modifications.


Quick Start
-------------
To get start with minimally supervised learning SOM for regression:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sh scripts/regression.sh    

To get start with minimally supervised learning SOM for classification:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sh scripts/classification.sh 

To test the trained SOM:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sh scripts/test.sh 

The datasets used for this project is currently private and will be released later.
