Minimally Supervised Topological Projections of Self-Organizing Maps
====================================================================
This is the implementation of Minimally Supervised Topological Projections of Self-Organizing Maps for regression and classification tasks. 

The code is implemented based on the `SUSI package <https://github.com/felixriese/susi>`_ with modifications.
